  /// Task is an interface for tasks that can be executed within BGThread.
  /** The purpose of #Task is to make it easy to move time-consuing operations
      away from the main thread of the application. Tasks are placed in the
      #Radiant::BGThread, that schedules and runs them as specified.

      Typical operations that can be implemented with tasks are:

      <UL>
      <LI>Loading data from disk</LI>
      <LI>Creating new widgets, before inserting them into the scene</LI>
      <LI>Checking for changes in the application configuration files</LI>
      </UL>

      <B>Please note</B> that Tasks are expected to execute fast. In other words,
      a task should not perform long, blocking operations. Such operations (for
      example database queries, or network file transfers), are best handled by
      launching a separate thread for them. For this purpose,
      see #Radiant::Thread.

      If you implement tasks that take a long time to execute, you should check
      the task state periodically inside you Task::doTask function and return from
      the method if the task is set to Task::DONE state. Otherwise your application
      may stall for a while when closing down because the application will wait
      for any tasks to finish before it stops the BGThread running them.

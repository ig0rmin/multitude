  /** Audio sample player for Resonant.

      This class implements a basic sample player, which can be used
      as a minimal synthesizer.

      <B>Note management:</B> Playing samples become notes that can be controlled by the user.
      If you play the same sample many times, each note is treated individually.
      For this purpose the functions that start sample playback return NoteInfo objects that can
      be used to query the state of the note.

      <B>Memory management:</B> The samples (aka audio files)
      are read from the disk as they are needed. The samples are loaded when they
      are first used. To force the loading of a particular sample, you can
      play the sample with zero volume. Samples are never dropped away from the
      RAM which may cause memory usage issues if the application is using a lot
      sound files.

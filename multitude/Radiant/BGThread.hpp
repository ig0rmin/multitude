  /** A class used to execute tasks in a separated threads.

    BGThread implements a thread-pool of one or more threads that are used to
    execute simple tasks that take too much time to be performed in the
    main-thread. Typical use-cases are generating mip-maps and converting
    images, loading large resources from disk or database, streaming resources
    over network, etc.

    BGThread owns tasks added to it and handles their destruction and memory
    management for you. If you need to keep a pointer to a task in BGThread,
    you should use the shared_ptr returned by Radiant::BGThread::addTask.

    If you decide to hold an external pointer to any Radiant::Task running in a
    BGThread, take special care if you decide to modify the task outside. You
    may not know if the Task is currently being executed in another thread.

    It is possible to change the number of threads executing tasks on the fly
    in BGThread by using the Radiant::ThreadPool::run function.
